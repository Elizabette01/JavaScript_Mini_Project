# JavaScript Projects Collection üöÄ

Welcome to my collection of JavaScript projects! This repository contains a variety of small to medium-sized projects I‚Äôve built to practice and demonstrate my skills in vanilla JavaScript, DOM manipulation, event handling, and more.

Each project is stored in its own folder with clean and readable code. Feel free to explore, clone, or fork any of them.
